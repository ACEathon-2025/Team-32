## 🌟 Overview  
**DhanSaathi** is a smart financial assistant designed to help people overcome challenges in accessing financial support.  
It simplifies **form filling**, provides **loan eligibility insights**, and helps users find **relevant government schemes** — all in one platform.  

💬 *Making finance simple, accessible, and smart.*

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
Many people struggle to access financial schemes, loans, and support due to:
- Lack of awareness about available government schemes  
- Complex financial forms filled with technical terms  
- No proper credit history, leading to loan rejection  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution & Prototype  
DhanSaathi provides a unified platform with three key features:

### 📝 1. Form Helper  
Upload a photo of any bank or loan form — our AI scans and detects fields.  
- Guides the user with hints on what to fill.  
- Displays **error messages** for invalid inputs.  
- Simplifies complicated forms for everyone.  

### 💸 2. Loan Eligibility Checker  
Many people need **small personal loans**, but banks often reject them due to missing documents.  
- Users enter income, expenses, and basic details.  
- System calculates a **credit score** and shows eligibility.  

### 🏛️ 3. Scheme Checker  
Government schemes are spread across multiple portals — users often don’t know **where to look or if they qualify**.  
- DhanSaathi collects and filters these schemes in one place.  
- Based on user details (age, income, category, etc.), it displays **eligible schemes instantly**.
